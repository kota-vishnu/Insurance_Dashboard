# ðŸ“Š Industrial Insurance Risk Analysis | Power BI Dashboard | 5M+ Records

---

## âœ¨ Executive Summary

This project presents a comprehensive risk analysis solution for a real-world industrial insurance dataset, spanning 5 years (2014â€“2018) with over **5 million records**. Leveraging advanced Power BI techniques, I developed an interactive dashboard enabling stakeholders to uncover risk patterns, optimize claim management, and enhance decision-making. 

By focusing on claims, premiums, customer segments, and vehicle usage patterns, this dashboard provides actionable insights to underwriters, claims managers, and executives in the insurance sector.
